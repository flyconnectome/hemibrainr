\arguments{
\item{someneuronlist}{a neuronlist or neuron object that has been modified by flow.centrality.}

\item{prepost}{whether to plot input (POST-) or output (PRE-) synapses, or both (default).}

\item{col}{colours of sections. Defaults to orange or axons, green for primary dendrite, blue for dendrites and pink for nodes with no flow.}

\item{splitnode}{if TRUE, a magenta sphere is placed at the location of the axon-dendrite split. Possible a putative action potential initiation site?}

\item{WithConnectors}{whether to plot the anatomical location of pre (red) and post (cyan) synapses.}

\item{WithNodes}{whether to plot branch points.}

\item{soma}{whether to plot a soma, and what the radius should be. If \code{NULL}, an appropriate value is guessed.}

\item{soma.alpha}{numeric, alpha transparency value for plotting the soma. Passed to \code{rgl::spheres3d}}

\item{transmitters}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, and transmitter identities are given in each neuron's meta data at neuron$connectors, then synapses.
are plotted in their transmitter colours. Transmitter identity is given by the colour of a halo around each synapse. The colours correspond to entries in \code{\link{paper_colours}}.}

\item{transmitter.alpha}{numeric, alpha transparency value for a coloured halo indicative of transmitter identity around synapses. Passed to \code{rgl::spheres3d}.}

\item{highflow}{whether to plot the nodes of highest (with in one standard deviation less than maximum) flow centrality (pink points).}

\item{lwd}{Line width (default 1).}

\item{radius}{For connectors and axon-dendrite split node (default 1). If \code{NULL}, an appropriate value is guessed.}

\item{already_selected}{a vector of IDs for neurons that are already considered selected. If \code{NULL} then no neurons are considered selected to start with.}

\item{check.template}{check which template space \code{someneuronlist} is in, in order to set default plotting settings.}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to methods.}

\item{Verbose}{logical indicating that info about each selected neuron should be printed (default TRUE)}

\item{Wait}{logical indicating that there should be a pause between each displayed neuron}

\item{sleep}{time to pause between each displayed neuron when Wait=TRUE}

\item{selected_file}{an optional path to a yaml file that already contains a selection}

\item{selected_col}{the color in which selected neurons (such as those specified in selected_file) should be plotted}

\item{yaml}{a logical indicating that selections should be saved to disk in (human-readable) yaml rather than (machine-readable) rda format}

\item{brain}{a template brain to plot. \code{FALSE} results in no brain plotted.}

\item{volume}{a \code{mesh3d} or \code{hxsurf} object. Only somas outside this volume will be plotted.}

\item{invert}{logical, if \code{TRUE} only somas outside \code{volume} will be plotted, if \code{FALSE}, only those inside.}
